# Roadmap

Fizz aims to deliver on **simpilicity** and **Zig integration**. This means the
following biases:

- Simplicity over expressiveness.
- Ease of Zig build over porting to C/C++/Rust/...
- Simplicity over performant.
  - Fizz aims to be about as fast as Python.

# Releases

## 0.1.0

Status: Feature set implemented. In validation phase.

## 0.2.0

Focus on:

- Improved error reporting.
- Incorporating user feedback.
- Performance tweaks.
