# Roadmap

Fizz aims to deliver on **simpilicity** and **Zig integration**. This means the
following tradeoffs may happen:

- Simplicity over expressiveness.
- Simplicity over performance.
  - Fizz aims to be about as performant as Python.
- Ease of Zig build over porting to C/C++/Rust/...

# Releases

## 0.1.0

Status: Target feature set implemented. In validation phase.

## 0.2.0

Will focus on:

- Improved error reporting.
- Incorporating user feedback.
- Performance tweaks.
